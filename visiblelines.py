''' Question:-
Hidden surface removal is a problem in computer graphics that scarcely needs an introduction: when Woody is standing in front of Buzz, you should be able to see Woody but not Buzz; when Buzz is standing in front of Woody, ... well, you get the idea.
The magic of hidden surface removal is that you can often compute things faster than your intuition suggests. Here's a clean geometric example to illustrate a basic speed-up that can be achieved. You are given n nonvertical lines in the plane, labeled L, . .., Ln, with the ith line specified
by the equation y = ax + b; We will make the assumption that no three of
the lines all meet at a single point. We say line L; is uppermost at a given ×-coordinate x if its y-coordinate at x is greater than the y-coordinates of all the other lines at xo: aixo + b; > a;xo + b; for all j+ i. We say line L; is visible if there is some x-coordinate at which it is uppermost -intuitively, some portion of it can be seen if you look down from "y = ∞o."
Give an algorithm that takes n lines as input and in O(n log n) time returns all of the ones that are visible. '''
'''Algortihm:-

1. Define a `Line` class to represent each line with coefficients `a` and `b`, along with an `index` to keep track of the line's position.

2. Implement a `__lt__` method in the `Line` class to compare lines based on the slope (`a`) and y-intercept (`b`). This allows sorting the lines based on their slope and y-intercept in ascending order.

3. Define a `is_visible` function that takes a list of lines and the index of a line and checks if the line is visible. It iterates over all other lines and checks if the y-intercept of the line is greater than the y-intercepts of the other lines. If any other line has a greater y-intercept, the line is not visible.

4. Implement a `find_visible_lines` function that takes a list of lines as input and returns a list of indices of the visible lines. It sorts the lines based on their slope and y-intercept using the `sorted` function. Then, it iterates over the sorted lines and checks if each line is visible using the `is_visible` function. If a line is visible, its index is added to the `visible_lines` list.

5. Take the input from the user for the number of lines and the coefficients (a, b) for each line.

6. Call the `find_visible_lines` function with the input lines to obtain the list of visible lines.

7. If there are visible lines, print them with their respective line indices. Otherwise, print "No visible lines."

The algorithm sorts the lines based on their slope and y-intercept in O(n log n) time complexity. Then, it iterates over the sorted lines, checking visibility for each line in O(n) time complexity. Hence, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n).
